## Class Title
Controlling Visuals with Audio - An Introduction

## Authors
Ashley Bellouin & Cassie Tarakajian

## Essential Questions
- What are the basic components of sound? 
- What are the basic components of video?
- What feels like a natural way to interact with an instrument?

## Introduction
This workshop will focus on using Max to create an audio/visual instrument. Starting from a beginner's standpoint, we will introduce Max and cover the basics of the software, then focus on creating an interactive program that uses audio to control visuals. The audio can be either live input or prerecorded samples. At the end of the workshop, students should understand how to create their own audio/visual instruments that anyone can play through a few simple button presses, or by clapping their hands. 

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
Age 14-18/beginner
No prerequisites required. This course is designed for people who have never used Max before.

### Outcomes & Goals
Students should walk away with a complete Max patch that uses audio to control visuals. 

### Pacing / Duration
~ 2 hours total

- Break down of the class schedule: 
  - :10 Check-ins
  - :15 Introduction to Max
  - :30 Audio in Max: live input, samples, scaling & analysis 
  - :05 Stretch break!
  - :30 Vizzie: visual effects, controlling effects with audio
  - :20 Lab time to work on patches
  - :10 Wrap up

## Materials Needed
Please have Max 8 installed on all computers before the start of class. 

### Exercises To Do Before Class
No exercises required.

### Vocabulary (example)
- Patch: This refers to the programs that you create in Max.
- Program: A procedure, or set of instructions, that performs a specific task when executed by a computer.
- Programming Language: The human-readable commands and syntax (or grammar rules) used to write programs.
- Graphical Programming Language: A programming language in which users create programs by manipulating elements using a GUI (graphical user interface) rather than using text.
- User Interface (UI): The means by which the user and a computer system interact.

## Exercise Descriptions
For the final lab time, experiement with different sounds and visual effects. Which effects should be changing and which should be static? How do you want to interact with your patch? Determine the interaction you want, then create the UI. At the end of class be ready to explain what you did and why.

## Post Session

### Implementation Guidance & Teaching Reflection  
- The main goal of this course should be to have fun and inspire the students! Attention spans can quickly diminish if too much time is spent instructing. Instead of lecturing, make sure students quickly start creating patches.

- Students learn better when they make their own patches, instead of playing with pre-built ones. Have them patch along in the beginning, then make sure to have dedicated lab time where they can create their own work.

- A lot of class time can be wasted finding audio and video samples online. Provide a curated selection of samples that they can work with. 

- Give students the opportunity to be teachers. Have them explain their work to each other.
